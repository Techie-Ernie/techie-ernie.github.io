A program made in Python, using libraries such as yt-dlp, moviepy, opencv, pyscenedetect and easyocr.
The program downloads a full video of a professional VALORANT match using yt-dlp and attempts to cut the video into
scenes using pyscenedetect. OpenCV is used to find the middle frame of each clip which is passed through EasyOCR to
check for the presence of "replay", which is an indication of a highlight worth including. The videos are sent through a
ffmpeg script and made into a video using MoviePy.
