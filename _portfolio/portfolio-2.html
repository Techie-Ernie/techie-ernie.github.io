A program made in Python, using libraries such as yt-dlp, moviepy, opencv, pyscenedetect and easyocr. <br>
The program downloads a full video of a professional VALORANT match using yt-dlp and attempts to cut the video into
scenes using pyscenedetect. <br>
OpenCV is used to find the middle frame of each clip which is passed through EasyOCR to
check for the presence of "replay", which is an indication of a highlight worth including. <br>
The videos are sent through a ffmpeg script and made into the final video using MoviePy. <br>
Will be open sourcing the project soon, new features I added include custom overlays and a GUI using HTML/CSS/JS. I'm hoping to add automatic TikTok uploads to test the program. <br>
