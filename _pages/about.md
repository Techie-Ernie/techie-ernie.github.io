CORE is the coalescence of ideals, expertise, and passion. In the supersaturated cauldron of pay-to-win Robotics “education” centers, CORE rises above, because we are not afraid of losing; we are afraid that our students do not learn, that they walk away with a false sense of achievement.

We are decorated roboticists at the national and international level at the most technically demanding competitions, yet we do not rest on our laurels. We are constantly connecting with the robotics industry, working on the hardest problems of the time, and studying research fresh off the press before distilling all this knowledge down to a level comprehensible even to the beginner.

The execution of our methodology is highly demanding, requiring the most dedicated and knowledgeable trainers. Yet it is only with this rigor that we have developed engineers, programmers, and roboticists sought after by the top universities in the world.

Education in schools is just a small subset of Education.

As consultants, we strive to give our clients an understanding of the current state and the future of the industry so that they can best harness the power of robotics in the present moment, and set themselves on a path to develop breakthroughs in the future.

As roboticists, we build solutions that bring to life the possibilities offered by robotics and design, to inspire others by showing off the possibilities of a rapidly developing field.
